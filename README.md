Left clicking on the minimap icon starts and stops logging, when logging is stopped the total number of items in the log will be displayed.  
Right clicking opens the menu.  
While logging all items moused over will be logged, selecting "Loot only" will limit logging to items in loot frame (supports standard and Xloot loot frames)  
Select details you want to log, CSV mode is likely to be more useful.  
/rl or relogging will save data in the log to "TurtleWow"\WTF\Account\"account name"\SavedVariables\ItemTooltipLogger.lua
